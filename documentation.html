        <h2>Documentation</h2>
        <p>For my design process, I started looking at what data I wanted to be displayed. After having analyzed
            the data, I came up with one question that I wanted to answer with a visualization more than any other: What
            percentace of each passenger class survived the accident. I knew that innevitably the first class would have
            a higher percentage, but I wasn't sure by how much. The results were actually shocking to say the least.
            <br><br>
            I
            realized when I got the results that the visualization would look great as a bar graph. Although the chart
            says a lot, it doesn't have a ton of extra components to it. That's when I decided to add some metadata for
            each class when hovered over. That way the main information that the visualization is trying to get across
            to the viewer is by default the main focus, but if the viewer wants to know just a little more about how
            these numbers were generated, then they get it with the hover effect. I also think that this
            metadata gives the visualization a sense of trust because it allows for the data to be quickly displayed without needing to go
            into the csv file to find it and calculate it yourself.
            <br><br>
            The bar chart itself is also purposefuly minimalistic. I like that the black background makes the orange
            bars and white chart axes pop out and grab your attention. I also didn't want too many distracting effects
            on the visualization, so I avoided using transitions and stuck to basic mouseover and mouseout listeners.
            <br><br>
            As far as what I learned from the visualization was how incredibly unfair the dynamic was for the passengers
            that were aboard the Titanic. Even though the numbers don't represent every sinlge passenger that was on the
            titanic, it gives you a good idea of what the power dynamic was on the ship when it inevitably started
            sinking. The other interesting thing I took away from the visualization actually comes the metadata. You see
            that women survived at a much higher percentage than men. I knew there was a great chance of this being the
            case, but I wasn't entirely sure because most of what I knew about the titanic unfortunately originated from
            the movie (I know don't judge me) in which the women and children are prioritized for the life boats.
